## Features

- **Agent Mode with Tool Calling:** An AI agent that can actively work with your vault! It can search for files, read content, create new notes, edit existing ones, move and rename files, create folders, and even conduct deep research with proper citations. Features persistent sessions, granular permission controls, and session-specific model configuration.
- **Semantic Vault Search:** [Experimental] Search your vault by meaning, not just keywords. Uses Google's File Search API to index your notes in the background. The AI can find relevant content even when you don't remember exact words. Supports PDFs and attachments, with pause/resume controls and detailed status tracking.
- **Context-Aware Agent:** Add specific notes as persistent context for your agent sessions. The agent can access and reference these context files throughout your conversation, providing highly relevant and personalized responses.
- **Smart Summarization:** Quickly generate concise, one-sentence summaries of your notes and automatically store them in the document's frontmatter, using a dedicated Gemini model optimized for summarization.
- **Selection-Based AI Features:** Work with selected text in powerful ways:
  - **Rewrite**: Transform selected text with custom instructions - right-click and choose "Rewrite with Gemini"
  - **Explain Selection**: Get AI explanations using customizable prompts - right-click and choose "Explain Selection"
  - **Ask about Selection**: Ask any question about selected text - right-click and choose "Ask about Selection"
- **IDE-Style Completions:** Get real-time, context-aware text completions as you type, similar to IDEs. Accept completions with `Tab` or dismiss with any other key. This feature uses a dedicated Gemini model for optimized completion generation.
- **Persistent Agent Sessions:** Store your agent conversation history directly in your vault as markdown files. Each session is stored in the `gemini-scribe/Agent-Sessions/` folder, making it easy to backup, version control, and continue conversations across sessions.
- **Configurable Models:** Choose different Gemini models for chat, summarization, and completions, allowing you to tailor the AI's behavior to each task.
- **Custom Prompt System:** Create reusable AI instruction templates for agent sessions, allowing you to customize the AI's behavior for different workflows (e.g., technical documentation, creative writing, research). Includes command palette commands for easy creation and management.
- **Image Paste Support:** Paste images directly into the chat input to send them to Gemini for multimodal analysis. Images are automatically saved to your Obsidian attachment folder, displayed as thumbnails before sending, and the AI receives the image path for embedding in notes.
- **MCP Server Support:** Connect to local [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers to extend the agent with external tools. Configure per-tool trust settings, and MCP tools integrate seamlessly with the existing confirmation flow and loop detection. Desktop only.
- **Built-in Prompt Templates:** The plugin uses carefully crafted Handlebars templates for system prompts, agent prompts, summarization prompts, selection rewrite prompts, and completion prompts. These ensure consistent and effective AI interaction.
- **Data Privacy:** All interactions with the Groq API are done directly from your machine. No data is sent to any third-party servers other than Groq. Agent session history is stored locally in your Obsidian vault as markdown files.
- **Robust Session Management:**
  - Persistent agent sessions that survive restarts
  - Session-specific permissions and settings
  - Context files that persist across the session
  - Full conversation history with tool execution logs
  - Easy backup and version control of sessions

2. Ask the agent to help with vault operations
3. Review and approve actions (if confirmation is enabled)

**Available Tools:**

- **Search Files by Name:** Find notes by filename patterns (wildcards supported)
- **Search File Contents:** Grep-style text search within note contents (supports regex and case-sensitive search)
- **Read Files:** Access and analyze note contents
- **Create Notes:** Generate new notes with specified content
- **Edit Notes:** Modify existing notes with precision
- **Move/Rename Files:** Reorganize and rename notes in your vault
- **Delete Notes:** Remove notes or folders (with confirmation)
- **Create Folders:** Organize your vault with new folder structures
- **List Files:** Browse vault directories and their contents
- **Web Search:** Search the web with Groq compound models (if enabled)
- **Fetch URLs:** Retrieve and analyze web content

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Errors:** Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions. Get a new key at [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).
- **No Responses:** Check your internet connection and make sure your API key is valid.
- **Slow Responses:** The speed of responses depends on the Gemini model and the complexity of your request. Larger context windows will take longer.
- **Completions Not Showing:**
  - Ensure completions are enabled via the command palette
  - Try typing a few words and pausing to trigger the suggestion
  - Check that you're in a Markdown file
  - Disable other completion plugins that might conflict
- **History Not Loading:** Ensure "Enable Chat History" is enabled and the "History Folder" is correctly set.
- **Custom Prompts Not Working:**
  - Ensure "Enable Custom Prompts" is toggled on in settings
  - Verify the prompt file exists in the Prompts folder
  - Check that the wikilink syntax is correct: `[[Prompt Name]]`
  - Try using the command palette commands for easier management
  - See the [Custom Prompts Guide](docs/guide/custom-prompts.md) for detailed troubleshooting
- **Parameter/Advanced Settings Issues:**
  - Check if your model supports the temperature range you're using
  - Reset temperature and Top P to defaults if getting unexpected responses
  - Enable model discovery to get latest parameter limits
  - See the [Advanced Settings Guide](docs/reference/advanced-settings.md) for detailed configuration help
- **Agent Mode / Tool Issues:**
  - Verify your Gemini model supports function calling (all Gemini 2.0+ models do)
  - If tools fail, check file permissions and paths
  - System folders (plugin state folder, .obsidian) are protected from modifications
  - For session issues, try creating a new session from the chat interface
  - Check the console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) for detailed error messages
  - Tool loop detection may stop repeated operations - adjust settings if needed
